# Room-Occupancy-Estimation

• Predicted room occupancy using diverse sensor data for class imbalance dataset.

• Implemented logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, SVM, and NN models and compared them 
  with off-the-shelf models.
  
• Identified Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as the best data representation, achieving a remarkable F1 
  score of 99% with Logistic Regression, contributing to improved accuracy in occupancy prediction.
